# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp

## Semantic Versioning :mage:

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

-  **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
-  **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
-  **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## Install the Terraform CLI
### Considerations with the Terraform CLI changes
The Terraform CLI installation instructions have changed due to gpg keyring changes. 
So we need to refer to the install CLI instructions via Terraform documentation and
change the scripting for installation.

### Considerations for Linux distribution
This project is built against Ubuntu. Please consider checking your Linux distribution and change accordingly

How to check your Linux version/flavor

```
$ cat /etc/os-release

PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.4 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
UBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy
```

### Refactoring into Bash scripts
While fixing the Terraform CLI gpg deprecation issues we noticed the bash scripts steps were a considerable
amount of code. So we decided to create a bash script to install the Terraform CLI.

This bash script is located at [./bin/install_terraform_cli.sh](./bin/install_terraform_cli.sh)

- This will keep the Gitpod Task File ([gitpod.yml file](gitpod.yml)) tidy
- This allows us easier to debug and execute manually Terraform CLI install
- This will allow better portability for other projects that need to install Terraform

### Shebang

A Shebang tells the bash script what interpreter program will interpret the script. eg: `#!/bin/bash`

ChatGPT recommends that we use this format for bash: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

## Execution considerations

When executing the bash sript we can use the `./` shorthand notation to execute the bash script

eg. `./bin/install_terraform_cli.sh`

If we are using a script in gitpod.yml we need to point the script to a program to interpret it

eg. `source ./bin/install_terraform_cli.sh`

## Gitpod Lifecycle (before, init, command)

We need to be careful when using the init because it will not rerun if we restart an existing workspace

https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks


### Working with environment variables

#### env command

We can list out all the environment variables (env vars) using the `env` command

We can filter out specific env vars using the `env | grep terraform`.

#### Setting and unsetting env vars

In the terminal we can set using the `export HELLO='world'`

We can unset using the `unset HELLO`

Within a bash script we can set an env var without writing export eg.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/bash

HELLO='world'

echo $HELLO
```

#### Printing env vars

We can print an env var using `echo` eg. `echo $HELLO`

#### Scoping of env vars

When you open a new bash terminal in VSCode, it will not be aware of any env vars that are set in another terminal.

If you want env vars to persist across all future terminals that are open, you need to set env vars in your bash profile eg. `.bash_profile`

#### Persisting env vars in Gitpod

We can persist env vars into gitpod using the gitpod secrets storage.

```
gp env HELLO='world'
```

All future workspaces  launched will set the env vars for all bash terminals opened in those workspaces.

You can also set env vars in the `gitpod.yml` file, but this can contain only non-sensitive env vars.


### AWS CLI installation

AWS CLI is installed for the project through the bash script [`./bin/install_aws_cli.sh`](./bin/install_aws_cli.sh)

[Getting started with AWS CLI installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

[AWS CLI Env Vars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

We can check if our AWS credentials is configured correctly by running the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

If it is successful, we should be able to see a json payload like this
```
{
    "UserId": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/tf-bootcamp"
}
```


We'll need to generate AWS CLI credentials from IAM user in order to use the AWS CLI


## Terraform Basics

### Terraform Registry

Terraform sources providers and modules from the Terraform registry, located at [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io)

- **Providers** are plugins that allow Terraform to interact with specific cloud platforms or APIs. They act as a bridge between Terraform and the underlying system we want to configure

- **Modules** are reusable, logical units of code files that are used to configure the underlying system. They make it easier to organise, reuse and manage terraform code

### Terraform Lock Files

`.terraform.lock.hcl` contains the locked versioning for the providers and the modules that should be used with this project. Lock files **should be committed** to the version contol system (ex: github).

### Terraform State Files

`terraform.tfstate` file contains information about the current state of the infrastructure. THis file **should not be committed** to the version control system, as it contains sensitive data about the infrastructure.

If this file is lost, we lose knowing the state of our infrastructure.

`.terraform.tfstate.backup` is the previous state file.

### Terraform Directory

`.terraform` directory contains the binaries of terraform providers.

### Terraform destroy
This will destroy resources. We can use the --auto-approve option to skip approval prompt.

### Consideration for S3 bucket creation
While creating an S3 bucket using the random string provider, make sure to not use upper case letters, as the name of a bucket should not contain upper case. Also avoided special characters, as bucket name accepts only (.) and (-)


## Issues with Terraform Cloud Login and Gitpod workspace

When attempting to "run" terraform login, it will launch in bash a WISWIG view to generate a token. However it does not work as expected in gitpod VS Code environment in browser. 

The workaround is to manually generate a token in Terraform Cloud (link below)

```
https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens?source=terraform-login
```

Then create a file manually in the below path, and copy the token generated on app.terraform.io to this file, in the specified json format:

```
/home/gitpod/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
```

Use the ```open /home/gitpod/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json``` command in bash to open the file in gitpod, and paste the below json format:

```
{
  "credentials": {
    "app.terraform.io": {
      "token": "YOUR TOKEN HERE"
    }
  }
}
```
